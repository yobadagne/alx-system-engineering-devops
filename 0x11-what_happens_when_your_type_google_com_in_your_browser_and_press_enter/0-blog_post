This is an article about what happens when one types "https://www.google.com" in a browser and hit enter.
In this articel I will to cover the main concept such as :
=>DNS request
=>TCP/IP
=>Firewall
=>HTTPS/SSL
=>Load-balancer
=>Web server
=>Application server
=>Database

Lets go into it.

So the very first step for a browser would be to look for the DNS of google.com. Usually the browesr would have a DNS cache to store recently visited site's DNS. So it will look for the DNS address from its cache and if it is available it will proceed to the next step of making the connection, but if the address is not available in its cache then it will request a DNS server for the IP address.

After getting the Ip address of the web server, the browser will make a request for TCP connection, if its HTTPS a security protocol such as SSL/TLS will be used and an encripted communication will be initiated. TCP/IP is a protocol widely used in the internet world.

During the connection between the web browser and the server, usually there will be a firewall installed on the server and this firwall will make sure that the request from the browser is allowed, and if so it will allow the connection, but if not it will block.

For a web server with a high traffic, there is a load balancer to distribute the traffic to different servers serving the same content. Different algorithms such as round robins will be used accordingly. different web servers such as nginx has the capability to do load balancing.

Application server is generally any server the servers any application such as web server sql server and the like.
